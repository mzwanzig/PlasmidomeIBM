# PlasmidomeIBM
Individual-based model simulating the inter- and intracellular interaction of multiple plasmid types varying in traits such as plasmid cost, horizonal transfer rates and incompatibility. It demonstrates the assembly of plasmid communities in surface-attached isogenic bacterial populations and their robustness to perturbartions such as those associated with abrupt changes in environmental conditions, e.g. persistence of plasmid-encoded functions such as antibiotic resistance after a stop of abiotic selection of these traits.

The model is implemented in the multi-agent programmable modeling environment NetLogo, which is freely available from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. It was created under NetLogo Version 6.1.1.

Downloading and running the model file with NetLogo allows you to reproduce some predefinded simulation experiments, stored as setups in the 'BehaviorSpace' as well as to run simulations with self-defined parameters.

A complete description of the model is part of a manuscript published on bioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.297721): Zwanzig, M. & Berger, U. (2020): Self-organisation and persistence of antibiotic resistance in evolving plasmid communities. The manuscript is currently under review at the scientific journal eLife.
