# PlasmidomeIBM
Individual-based model simulating the inter- and intracellular interaction of diverse plasmids in a clonal bacterial population.

The model is implemented in the multi-agent programmable modeling environment NetLogo, which is freely available from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

Downloading and running the model file with NetLogo allows you to reproduce some predefinded simulation experiments, stored as setups in the 'BehaviorSpace' as well as to run simulations with self-defined parameters.

A complete description of the model is part of a manuscript entitled "Plasmid interaction networks maintain genetic diversity and costly antibiotic resistance" by Martin Zwanzig and Uta Berger, submitted to the scientific journal 'Molecular Systems Biology'. Feel free to use or modify this model for your own research, but please cite this publication. Requests for cooperation are also welcome.
