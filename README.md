# PlasmidomeIBM
Individual-based model simulating the inter- and intracellular interaction of diverse plasmids in a clonal bacterial population.

The model is implemented in the multi-agent programmable modeling environment NetLogo, which is freely available from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. It was created under NetLogo Version 6.1.1.

Downloading and running the model file with NetLogo allows you to reproduce some predefinded simulation experiments, stored as setups in the 'BehaviorSpace' as well as to run simulations with self-defined parameters.

A complete description of the model is part of a manuscript entitled "Modelling the impact of plasmid interactions on coexistence and antibiotic resistance in evolving plasmid communities" by Martin Zwanzig and Uta Berger, in review at the scientific journal eLife. If you plan to use or modify this model for your own research, please contact martin.zwanzig@tu-dresden.de
